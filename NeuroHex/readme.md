# 💀 NeuroHex

> _“Welcome to the end of your operating system.”_

**NeuroHex** is a sensory overload machine — a self-destructing Android experience built for digital chaos, glitch art, and psychological disturbance. Part concept app, part performance piece, NeuroHex isn't meant to be used. It's meant to be unleashed.

### 🔥 What It Does

Once launched, **NeuroHex** begins an irreversible meltdown:

- 🎨 **Flashing RGB Backgrounds** – Random, rapid-fire color shifts for visual disorientation.
- 🌀 **Glitching UI** – Title text mutates every few seconds with corrupted system warnings.
- 🔊 **Tactical Vibration** – Custom vibration patterns simulate rising system stress.
- 💣 **Self-Destruct Timer** – After 15 seconds, the app wipes its own internal files and kills itself.
- 🖐️ **Mercy Mechanism** – Tap 5 times quickly to stop the sequence and restore control — if you're fast enough.

### 👁️ The Concept

**NeuroHex** is designed to explore themes of:

- Digital fragility
- Sensory overwhelm
- Human control in automated systems
- The illusion of safety in software

It’s not a productivity app. It’s a statement.

### ⚠️ Disclaimer

This app **deletes files**, **vibrates indefinitely**, and **terminates the process** after a countdown. It is not designed for use on any device with real data or ongoing tasks. Run at your own risk.

> You have 15 seconds before the meltdown completes. Or... tap your way out.
