## 🧭 About This Repository

Welcome to my **Android App Collection** — a curated universe of mobile apps I've created on my journey through the Android development cosmos. This is more than a portfolio. It's a timeline of growth, exploration, and creativity — one app at a time.

Each folder in this repository is a self-contained Android project, crafted with modern practices, clean code, and meaningful design.
